## Building
To build, run the following (order matters!):
```sh
./bootstrap
./configure
make -s -j
```
These do a couple of things. `./bootstrap` generates the configure files and some other files needed. You must have `autoheader`, `autoconf`, and `automake` installed and working in order to compile it. `./configure` generates the makefile and guesses system dependent things as well as generate a required header. `make -s -j` compiles the program.
## Build options
To see build options (configure options), run `./bootstrap` and then `./configure --help` to see the options
