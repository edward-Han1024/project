# Installation Instructions

## Basic Installation
### Step 1: Build
To get a basic installation, execute the following commands (one by one):

```sh
./boostrap
./configure -C
make -s
make -s check
```
The first line should generate the autogenerated files. It requires `autoheader`, `autoconf`, `automake`, `libtoolize`, and `aclocal`. Building from source also requires the standard developer tools.
### Step 2: Install
Run `make install` to install. You may need to prefix it with `sudo` to get root permissions required to install sometimes.

## More options
Run `./configure --help` after `./bootstrap` to see more options.
